# What is Gainful?

Job searches are tedious. Government websites are awful. It makes searching for government jobs uniquely painful.

Gainful makes government job postings simple and sane. Every morning, we find the newest jobs and present them in a table. You can filter and sort the table however you want.

No signups. No ads. Using Gainful could not be easier.

## What job sites does Gainful search?

Glad you asked. Gainful searches the following sources:

- City of Toronto
- City of Brampton
- City of Mississauga
- Peel Region
- York Region
- City of Markham
- Halton Region
- City of Oakville
- City of Burlington

# What is Gainful?

Job searching is bad. Government websites are bad. This makes searching for government jobs extra bad.

Gainful makes government job postings simple and sane. Every day, it finds all the newest postings and present them in a table. You can filter and sort listings however you want, and save your results as a daily email newsletter.

No signups, no ads. It could not be easier.

## What job sites does Gainful search?

Glad you asked. Gainful searches the following sources:

- City of Toronto
- City of Victoria
- City of Mississauga
- Ontario Public Service in the GTA (TODO)
- ...etc

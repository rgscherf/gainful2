This makes searching for government jobs extra bad.\n\nGainful makes government job postings simple and sane. Every day, it finds all the newest postings and present them in a table. You can filter and sort listings however you want, and save your results as a daily email newsletter.\n\nNo signups, no ads. It could not be easier.\n\n## What job sites does Gainful search?\n\nGlad you asked. Gainful searches the following sources:\n\n- City of Toronto\n- City of Victoria\n- City of Mississauga\n- Ontario Public Service in the GTA (TODO)\n- ...etc\n\n## Can I help?\n\n[twitter]: http://www.twitter.com/rgscherf\n\nYes! [Get in touch][twitter] or make a [pull request](http://www.github.com/rgscherf/gainful2).\n\n## Who wrote Gainful?\n\nGainful is written by Robert Scherf. He\'s looking for a job--[hire him][twitter]!\n\n");
